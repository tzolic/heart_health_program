# Heart Health Program ❤️

## Purpose 🎯

Be aware of your heart’s health condition.

## What is an ERICE score? 🤔

An ERICE score is the likelihood in percentage that you will experience heart-related issues within the next 10 years (it's a bit depressing but better be safe than surprised).

## Blood pressure and cholesterol 🩸

### What are systolic & diastolic blood pressure? And cholesterol?

- systolic: measure of the pressure in your arteries while your heart is beating.
  
- diastolic: measure of the pressure in your arteries while your heart is resting in between heartbeats.
  
- cholesterol: fatty substance found in your blood, necessary for building healthy cells. However, high levels of cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease.

### How to enter them if you don’t have a blood pressure reading?

I obviously don’t expect you to have a specific reading of them. You can use the ideal range for reference:

- systolic: 90-120mmHg
- diastolic: 60-80mmHg
- cholesterol: ≤ 5.2mmol/L
